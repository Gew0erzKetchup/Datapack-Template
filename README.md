# Datapack Template

## Instructions

1. **Download and Extract the Files**  
   Download the files and extract them to your desired directory.

2. **Edit the `pack.mcmeta` File**  
   Open the `pack.mcmeta` file and modify both the description and the `pack_format` value.  
   Example: For version 1.21, the `pack_format` value should be 48. You can find the correct `pack_format` for your Minecraft version here:

3. **Update the `load.json` and `tick.json` Files**  
   Navigate to `minecraft/tags/functions/load.json` and edit the example to suit your needs.  
   Do the same for `tick.json`.  
   **Important**: The content in both `tick.json` and `load.json` must be identical.

4. **Apply Changes in the `data` Folder**  
   Go to the `data` folder and ensure that the examples match the changes you made in `load.json` and `tick.json`.

5. **Enjoy!**  
   Your datapack is now ready to use. Enjoy!
